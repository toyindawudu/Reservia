**Project Title**
Reservia 

**Project Description**
This is a booking reservation travel website

**Technologies Used**
1. HTML
2. CSS 

**Approach**

I am creating a prototype using a design created by the UI designer, Loic. My approach is to use a mobile-first approach and use flexbox primarily where possible to make my work responsive.

**Technical Constraints**
1. The site font is Raleway
2. The colors of the chart are blue #0065FC and its lighter version #DEEBFF, as well as grey for the background #F2F2. 

**Pain-Points**
1. Making the site responsive was something that I foound quite challenging
2. Not knowing how to use a software that could give me accurate measurements made the process troublesome 

**Features of the website**
- Users can search through their choice of cities
- The menu must be anchored to the respective section on the site
- Filter doesn't work but must be dynamic in hover states etc.
- Every accommodation and activities card must be clickable


**Limitations**
- Only HTML + CSS
- Use semantic tags and the document must not contain any errors
- Compatability across browsers
