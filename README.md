I am creating a prototype using a design created by the UI designer, Loic. 

Technical Constraints

1. The site font is Raleway
2. The colors of the chart are blue #0065FC and its lighter version #DEEBFF, as well as grey for the background #F2F2. 

Pain-Points


**Features of the website**
- Users can search through their choice of cities
- The menu must be anchored to the respective section on the site
- Filter doesn't work but must be dynamic in hover states etc.
- Every accommodation and activities card must be clickable


**Limitations**
- Only HTML + CSS
- Use semantic tags and the document must not contain any errors
- Compatability across browsers
